This is the interface of the Login page. In this interface the employee can login or register if he/she has not been registered yet. 
The design is made to cheer the employee up with the quotes. The quote of Login page is:

**Growth and change is painful, but nothing is as painful as staying stuck somewhere you don't belong**

## Register Page ##

This is the interface of the Register page. In this interface the employee can register if he/she has not been registered yet. The initial registration will be dealt by admin, so that not everyone can actually register in the company employee database.
The design is made to cheer the employee up with the quotes. The quote of Register page is:

**When you are wrong admit it, when you are right keep quiet**

## Admin Page ##
